# Prateek's solution

Implementation of Trello board

## Features

- React is set up from scratch (without CRA)
- Used Parcel for config-less build
- Commented parts of code for better understanding
- Organized code by folder (components, contexts, hooks)
- Used inbuilt context for state management
- Tried to make as much code reusable as possible

## Project Setup

Initialize the project

```bash
npm i
```

## Running the project

```bash
npm start
```

The project will start at

```
http://localhost:1234
```

## Conclusion

Had so much fun making this!
